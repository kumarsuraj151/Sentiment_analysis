## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis with Word2Vec and Logistic Regression

### Introduction
This project is aimed at performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Word2Vec embeddings and logistic regression. In this project, I am using the Word2Vec model provided by the Gensim library to convert movie review texts into dense word embeddings, and then apply logistic regression for binary classification (1 for positive sentiment and 0 for negative sentiment).
